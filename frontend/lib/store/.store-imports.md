# Store Import Cheat Sheet

Quick reference for importing from Zustand stores:

## Client Components (with hooks)

```typescript
"use client";
import { useAnalyticsStore, useDashboardStore } from "@/lib/store";
```

## Server Components (types only)

```typescript
import type { AnalyticsStoreState, DashboardStoreState } from "@/lib/store/types";
```

## Remember

- ✅ Hooks → `@/lib/store` (client components only)
- ✅ Types → `@/lib/store/types` (anywhere)
- ❌ Never import hooks in server components
- ❌ Never import from individual store files (`use-*-store.ts`)
